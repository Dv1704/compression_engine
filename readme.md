# 📦 Compression Engine (Rust)

A simple command-line tool written in Rust to compress files using the Gzip format. Built using the [`flate2`](https://docs.rs/flate2/) crate, it provides fast and effective compression for large files.

---

## ✨ Features

- Compress any file to `.gz` format
- Displays performance metrics:
  - Original file size
  - Compressed file size
  - Compression ratio
  - Time taken to compress

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 Build the project

```bash
cargo build --release
````

### 📥 Compress a file

```bash
cargo run -- <source_file> <target_file.gz>
```

#### Example

```bash
cargo run -- book.pdf book.pdf.gz
```

Output:

```
✅ Compression complete
🗂️  Source file: 18808038 bytes
📦 Compressed file: 5432206 bytes
📉 Compression ratio: 28.88%
⏱️  Time taken: 6.14s
```
